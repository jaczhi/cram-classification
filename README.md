## File Structure

`src-efficuts` folder contains code by original authors of:

> Vamanan, Balajee, Gwendolyn Voskuilen, and T. N. Vijaykumar. "EffiCuts: Optimizing packet classification for memory and throughput." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 40, no. 4 (2010): 207-218.

`cramcuts` contains our implementation of Efficuts + our CramCuts heuristic.

`reproducibility` contains our report's figure comparing the number of rules to total memory and maximum tree depth.

`hyperparameter` contains code that finds the most optimum value for certain parameters of our implementation.
